uart2
=========
This project contains a simple example reading data from UART1 
and writing to UART2 (and vice versa) 

The project makes use of code from the following library projects:
- CMSISv1p30_LPC17xx : for CMSIS 1.30 files relevant to LPC17xx
- MCU_Lib        	 : for LPC17xx peripheral driver files
- EaBaseBoard_Lib    : for Embedded Artists LPCXpresso Base Board peripheral drivers

These library projects must exist in the same workspace in order
for the project to successfully build.
